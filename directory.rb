#let's put all students into an array
students = [
"Hadi",
"Karin",
"James",
"Sean",
"Fadie"]
#and then print them
puts "The students of my cohort at Makers Academy"
puts "--------------"
puts students[0]
puts students[1]
puts students[2]
puts students[3]
puts students[4]
#finally, we print the total
print "Overall, we have #{students.length} great students"
#it's important that print() doesn't add new line characters
